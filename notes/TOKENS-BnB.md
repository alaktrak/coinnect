# TOKENOMICS HIGH LEVEL
# Summarization of https://research.binance.com/static/pdf/Tokenomics_Deep_Dive_Stefan_Piech_Shivam_Sharma.pdf
# 

Tokenomics can be defined as the study of determining and evaluating the
economic characteristics of a cryptographic token
    - study of determining and evaluating the economic characteristics of a cryptographic token.
    - best understand how various incentives affect the supply and demand of a token
      and, ultimately, its price.

    Key aspects of token supply: 
        - Allocation
        - Vesting Period
        - Emission
    
    Issues of Token Design
        - Incentive function of the token
        - Centralized risks
        - Participation rewards
        - Foundation design

Tokenization represents a form of digitalization of value. The utility comes
from a token fulfilling one of multiple purposes
    - Trust plays an essential role in the utility of tokens
    - Transparent and healthy governance can offer a lot of utility and drive
      token demand
    - A two-token model helps to specialize the use cases for each token by
      separating the “ecosystem” from a purpose-solving token

# TOKENOMICS BASICS
Raising Capital
    Allows Early contributors/adopters to invest in the project and gain upside
        Whereas only accredited investors are traditionally able to invest in equities.
        Particularly at the initial public offering (“IPO”) stage. This might take many years,
        usually far longer than it would take to create and distribute a token.

Marketing:    
    - Inclusivity and potential for active community governance can
      be an important factor for both company founders and investors alike. 
    - Increasing token allocations towards early adopters
    
Smart Contract Dynamics
    - Smart contracts allow you to program mechanisms into tokens
    - Tokens can be more dynamic in their nature and provide more use
      cases than alternative means of funding. It also means that there are a lot more variables
      to investigate and pay attention to when analyzing the tokenomics of any project

Governace
    - Tokens can serve as important pillars for governance
    - Effective tools to decentralize a protocol
        most commonly via a decentralized autonomous organization (“DAO”) structure.
    - Tokens can also ensure incentive alignment, with all parties, including infrastructure
      providers, users, and the development team benefiting and being motivated to keep growing.

# Token Supply
Allocations
    - Key Parties:
        - Founder / Core Team
            - Normally Longer Lock Up Periods
        - Private Investor (VCs, Seed Investors, Private Buyers, etc...)
        - Public Sale (ICO, IDO, public auction)
        - Foundation (allocated in order for the non-profit to support the token and ecosystem)
        - Ecosystem / Incentives (Funds earmarked for the community)
            - Grants
            - Airdrops
            - yield farming
            - Staking
        - Other
            - Charity Allocations
            - Strategic Partners
            - Early Ecosystem Participants
    - Key Questions
        - Centralization Risks
            - Are too many tokens concentrated among the Founders and Private Investors
            - If a significant amount is allocated towards ecosystem incentives / foundation / other
              which party has the control?
        - Participation Rewards
            - Reward Early Adopters / Developers
            - Balance between rewarding early usage versus keeping tokens for future incentives
        - Foundation
            - How much supply does foundation control
            - Does foundation have any community vote or is it privately run
            - Significant overlap between core team and board members of foundation?

    Vesting Period
        - Time period where the sale of a token is restricted after initial distribution and is 
          commonly also called the lockup period
        - Types of Periods:
            - time-based vesting
            - trigger-based vesting
                - typically kicked off following a token generation event, a mainnet launch, 
                  or the listing of the token.
                - Trigger-based vesting is more common
        - Higher levels of discount for longer lockups. 


    
    Emissions
        - Rate at which crypto tokens are released aka (Burn Rate)
            - Work out the relative inflationary (or deflationary)
            pressures that the token is likely to face in the future.
            
        - Emissions, burns, and other governance actions that impact supply can collectively be 
        called the monetary policy of a token, and as you would expect, this varies widely across 
        the market.
        
        - Emissions are typically distributed as part of block rewards, which are rewarded to miners
        or validators who are securing the chain. Some projects will also subsidize growth via
        inflation and issue tokens towards ecosystem incentives or to strategic partners. The basic
        laws of supply and demand are sufficient in deciphering the expected outcome of such a
        growth strategy.

        - Emissions can also be a result of transaction fees, which can be burned or sometimes
        rewarded to validators (or some combination of the two). Depending on network usage, if
        sufficient burning takes place, it could overpower the inflationary effect of block rewards and
        thus cause deflationary pressure on a token.

        - FDV (Fully Diluted Valutaion) vs Market Capitalization
            - Market Cap: Takes into account teh current circulating supply
                Current Supply * Current Market Price
            - FDV also factors in the maximum supply a token will ever have
                - Max Supply * Current Market Price
                - FDV is relevant for tokens that have a fixed supply
            - Emission Schedule:
                - What does the scheduled release look like for the
                remaining coins? Will circulation double in a short time period, or is it a longer-term
                schedule? How much dilution is expected and how quickly?
    
    DeFi APRs

    Airdrops
        - Originally a way to give free tokens to users as a way to:
            Reward early adopters or loyal users
            Promote the project
            Decentralize ownership
            Encourage governance participation
            - Issue: Users who might try and farm the airdrop (Known as Sybil Attackers)

        Types:
            Hop Protocol
                - Used community reports and self reports to get rid of addresses that were
                believed to be Sybil attackers
            Optimism:
                - Used community reports and suspicious L1/L2 activity
            Lockdrop:
                - Require commitment from the user to receive the tokens via lock up periods.
                - Lock up one set of tokens to receive the new one in the future

    Demand:
        - The incentive function can be seen as the function that drives demand or 
        incentivizes people to buy and ideally hold the token. It is often tied to some utility
        the token might have, such as governance, yields, or access to some type of service. 
        
        Governance of Projects
            - Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (“DAOs”)
                - Blockchain based structures that enable coordination of people and resouces through a formalized, transparent and binding set of rules deployed on a public blockchain.
            - Voting Power: How much is held by the team vs how much is held by market
                - One coin, One Vote
                - Vote Escrow - Higher voting power for locked tokens which aims to give more voting power to long-term holders.


        Different approaches to share revenues
        
        Utility of tokens
            Crucial element in creating demand of a token
            
            Utility can be solutions to problems, having a loyal an engaging community,
            yield and voting power.

            Ultimately, it is possible to define tokens as quantifiable representations of  decentralized and disintermediated trust.

             The utility comes from a token fulfilling one of multiple purposes.

            Yield Rewards
                Utility needs to tie to the core business model, and rewards can be used to encourage core behaviors and nudge the participants of a protocol.

            Revenue Sharing
                - Can be done both on and off chain
                    On Chain:
                        - through token rewards
                    Off Chain:
                        - buy and burn mechanism making token more scarce and thus increasing its value

            Vote Escrow
                -  incentivizes liquidity providers to become long-term stakeholders




Key Roles of Tokens:
    - Right (Engagement) - Product Usage, Governance, Voting, Contribution, Product Access, Ownership
    - Value Exchange (Economy Creation) - Work Rewards, Buying, Selling, Spending, Active/Passive Work, Create a product
    - A Toll (or Fee) (Skin in the game) Running smart contracts, security deposit, usage fees
    - A Function (Enriching Experience) Joining a network, connecting with users, incentive for users
    - Currency (Frictionless Transaction) Payment unit, transaction unit, store of value
    - A means of Earnings (Distributing Benefits) Profit Sharing, Benefit Sharing, Inflation Benefits


        
Two-token Model
    A two-token model provides two different tokens at the same time. This, in return, helps to
    specialize the use cases for each of the two tokens by separating the “ecosystem” from a
    purpose-solving token.

    Utility Token and a Governance token
        - Governance tokens help to manage a protocol without impacting the price of the utility token.
        - The best way to think about utility tokens is to imagine them as in-game currency,
        where you wouldn’t want to see large price fluctuations to exclude a huge majority of gamers and have an infinite supply to be able to scale the game without negative impacts from scarcity.
