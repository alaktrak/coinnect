# Impact of Token Architectures on Token Value

Token Price (Manifestation of Token Value)

    Speculative Component
        - Subject to Market Forces
        - Drive mostly by sentiment and perception
    
    Fundamental Component
        - Protocol Service
            - Determined by the utility of underlying product
        - Token Architecture


# Mechanisms in Token Architectures

Token Architecture:
    
    Utility Mechanisms
        Staking Mechanisms
            Liquidity Provision
            Proof-of-Stake
            Continuous Governance
            Safety Module
            Reputation
            Stake-for-Access
            Treasury Management
        Mint & Burn Mechanism
        Fee Distribution Mechanism
        Discount Mechanism 
            (Implement a discount mechanism into your token which would let users pay less for the underlying utility of the protocol than they would if they did not own/use the token)

    Governance Mechanisms
        Quorum
        Off-Chain Governance
        Vote Delegation
        Token Lookup

    Distribution Mechanisms
        Airdrop
        Auctions
        Bonding Curves
        Liquidity Bootstraping Pools
        Direct Listing
        IEOs
        Liquidity Mining


Types of Tokens:
    - Digital Resource Networks
        - Storage
        - Computing
        - Data Connectivity

        Uplink, falcon

    - Network Affect to Provide Services
        - Cold-Start Problem

        Marketplaces, Hunda for recruting, Lemonade for events

    - Data Unions
        Pooldata or Ozone

Pitfalls

    Conflicts between equity holders and token holders
        - Situation when part of the revenue goes to equity holders and part goes 
        to token holders

    (Arweave - On Chain Storage That Scales)
        - Mining System that encourages people to create replicas of the data set instead of 
        burning electricity on hashing

        - Economics: Endowment Structure: When you put data into Arweave you pay for 200 years of data
        storage upfront. Over Time the cost of Storage Declines -> This effectively gives you interest in
        terms of storage purchasing power on your original principal. After the first year you
        end up with about 260 years of purchasing power.

            Endowment is the mechanism that makes sure to only release tokens to pay for storage
            for everything else it should just accrue

        Permantent Storage of Dataset

    StakeHolders:
        - Miners - They want to earn tokens as fast as possible
        - Storers of Data - Permanence of Data
    
    Flow:
        Individual buys the token to match it with data that you want to store
        Miners then put data into a block
        13% of transaction fee is given to miner who creates the block
        Tokens are put into endowment which is shared across the entire dataset
            When block reward doesn't cover storage cost then take tokens from endowment to
            cover the cost (this is the burden of the network) so taht miners have some level of 
            profit to store the data

        AR Tokens
            66M Total Supply (11M to be released over time)
            Endowment will slowly take in tokens and then release over a long period of time

    SmartWeave: Lazily Evaluated Smart Contracts
        Distribute Tips when a user interacts with a decentralized system
            Relative to ownership share of the token
                Buy/Sell futures based on that profit stream
        
        Profit Sharing Communities
            Live on top of the network
            Place a DAO on top of the network
            The DAO governs the network that is hosting the storage data
            Representing Value Stream via a Token

        DAO in token Structure
            - Decentralized Autonomous Web Services that are governed by that DAO
            - Represent Value Stream in a Token
                - People can buy them
                - Receive them from governance
            - Receive Tips
                - In the token
                - In another token
                - Some other reward

            a token standard in revenue streams

        Mint profit sharing tokens in the application itself
            (bandcamp like app on Arweave)
            Albums can have profit sharing tokens attached to them and then you can buy and sell
            access to the profits of that album
            
            Also can buy/sell access to a token that represents profit sharing of the application
            as a whole (basket token)
