# Structure:
Service Requests
    Users (customers) post local service needs (plumbing, tutoring, deliveries, etc.)
    Includes: description, budget, preferred time/date, location

Decentralized Bidding System
    Providers bid with: price, availability, ratings, token staked (optional to boost trust)
    Users pick from bids OR the system auto-selects top matches via algorithm

Smart Contract Escrow
    Funds are locked in escrow upon provider selection
    Payment released upon verified completion (confirmed by user + review system)

Ratings & Reviews
    After service completion, both parties rate each other
    Reviews are weighted more heavily if backed by staked tokens

Calendaring & Cost
    All service listings include availability windows
    Cost is set by providers or dynamic (market-based based on demand)


# Incentives:
For Users:
    Earn tokens for high-value transactions, referrals, and good reviews
    Borrow from liquidity pool if short on funds
    Get discounts for staking tokens or holding NFTs (e.g. “Power User Badge”)

For Providers:
    Boost visibility by staking tokens
    Earn tokens based on satisfaction + speed + volume
    Early joiners get NFT badges with perks

For LPs:
    Yield from escrow usage + late fees + platform growth
    Can vote on system upgrades


# Tokenomics:
Inflows:
    Token buybacks from fees
    LP returns from borrower repayments
    Optional paid boosts from users/providers

Outflows:
    Rewards to users/providers
    Governance incentives
    Escrow withdrawals

Staking Mechanics:
    Longer stake = higher rewards, voting power, and trust
    Unstaking = cooldown penalty (discourages fast exits)
